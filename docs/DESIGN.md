# Implementation
There are three main parts of the Medical Colony:
* Condition (a task in Colony)
* Diagnoses (task solutions)
* Medical professionals, researchers, etc. (task evaluators and workers)

## Condition Enquiry
Contains a description, symptoms, and information about an unknown condition, possibly including images or what doctors theorized it could possibly be. Once an enquiry is submitted, it may be matched with an already existing condition based on supplied information. However, additional information can be requested if the matched condition / diagnoses does not fully match.

### Task Details
* __Deliverable:__ Diagnoses, causes, additional information, alternative symptoms, etc.
* __Due date:__ Never? Few months?
* __Payout:__ Funded by condition holder / family or by community, research institute, etc.
* __Domain:__ Physical, psychological, etc.
* __Skills:__ Orthopedics, nervous system, etc.

### Diagnosis Submission
Many different individuals or groups may collaborate together on figuring out what the condition is and what the causes may be.
The network would also encourage collaboration and provide positions for different specialties, such as a neurosurgeon providing biological possibilities and data scientists / machine learning algorithms to provide statistical analyses.

__Submitters:__
* Open the doors for anyone to contribute
* Allow the _evaluators_ to rate contributions
* Provide integrations into existing solutions such as WebMD or Wikipedia
